This project compares the performance of three algorithms for finding probability in a graphical model. The algorithms compared are:

* **Simple conclusion: **A basic algorithm for finding probability in a graphical model.
* **Variable Elimination Algorithm with ABC elimination order:** An optimized algorithm that uses the ABC elimination order to find probability in a graphical model.
* **Variable Elimination Algorithm with custom heuristic elimination order:** An optimized algorithm that uses a custom heuristic elimination order based on the number of appearances of variables in factors to find probability in a graphical model.
The project includes the implementation of each algorithm and the calculation of both the probability and the number of additions and multiplications required for each algorithm.
